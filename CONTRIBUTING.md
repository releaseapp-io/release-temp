# Contributing to Release and Awesome Release

For **help**, **support**, **questions** and **ideas** please use **[our issue tracker](https://github.com/releaseapp-io/release/issues)**  🚑.

## Where to Start

Release maintains a living library, under [Awesome-Release](https://github.com/awesome-release), of applications that run on Release out-of-the-box.

If you're a developer looking to contribute, but you're not sure where to begin, check out [Awesome-Release](https://github.com/awesome-release). These projects are open to improvements, maintenance, and upgrades. If you have created a starter app for Release, [open a ticket](https://github.com/releaseapp-io/release/issues) with us and we would **love** to integrate the app into Awesome-Release!

If you've got an idea for a new feature, please start by suggesting it in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/releaseapp-io/release/issues).


### Submitting Pull Requests

We aim to merge any straightforward, well-understood bug fixes or improvements immediately. We will even consider new features and larger changes without prior discussion to our example apps, as long as they still contain the spirit of the example and still run in Release. Any changes that would require configuration in Release to run need to be documented in the Readme.

Please provide plenty of context and reasoning around your changes, to help us merge quickly. Closing an already open issue is our preferred workflow. If your PR gets out of date, we may ask you to rebase as you are more familiar with your changes than we will be.
