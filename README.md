# About Release

Release unlocks the ability to create fully autonomous environments from any git branch. Built on the back of Kubernetes, you can be confident with Release's ability to scale your application, no matter what your stack looks like, all without having to know Kubernetes. Through the power of <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/instant-datasets" alt="instance datasets documentation">instant datasets</a>, each environment is built using data you can rely on.  

The easiest way to get get started with Release is to <a href="mailto:hello@releaseapp.io?subject=Release:%20Getting%20started%20with%20white-glove%20onboarding&body=I%20would%20like%20to%20hear%20about%20Release's%20white-glove%20onboarding%20process." alt="email hello@releaseapp.io">inquire about our white-glove onboarding</a> or <a href="https://calendly.com/tommy-release/60min" alt="Schedule a time with Tommy@Release with Calendly">schedule a demo</a>. If you're a self-starter or looking to unlock environments for your personal projects, check out the <a href="https://github.com/awesome-release" alt="Awesome Release">example applications</a> and explore the <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/" alt="Release Docs">documentation</a>.
